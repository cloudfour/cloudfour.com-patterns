This change improves the Cloud Cover component's layout when used with the Subscribe component. It makes the Subscribe headings optional, and improved the layout to switch to horizontal when there's enough room for two buttons, rather than a fixed breakpoint.

This is a breaking change because it removes the default values of the Subscribe component's headings.
