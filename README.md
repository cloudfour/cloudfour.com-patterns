## Installation

<!---
  note that this content is duplicated between readme.md and welcome.stories.mdx
  be sure to make any changes to both files!
-->

The package includes both the compiled code and the source files. So you can either include the compiled CSS and JS directly, or load the source files using your own build system. If you use the source files, you'll need to compile them yourself using Sass and PostCSS.

You can add the pattern library package as a dependency to your JavaScript application using npm:

```
npm install @cloudfour/patterns
```
