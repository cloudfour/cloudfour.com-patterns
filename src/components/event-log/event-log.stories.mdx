# Event Log

Displays a list of event details in chronological order. Designed to show the presentation history for talks, workshops or other events we’ve conducted.

For a less specialized display of tabular data, consider using [Table](/docs/components-table--basic). For simple string/number pairs, consider [Dot Leader](/docs/components-dot-leader--list). To display a single or upcoming date, consider using [Calendar Date](/docs/components-calendar-date--basic) (optionally combined with [Media](/docs/objects-media--event-summary)).

## Template Properties

### Container

- `class`: Append a class to the `c-event-log` element.
- `content` (Block): The contents of the containing element, presumably items.

### Item

- `date`: A string that is parseable by [Twig's `date` filter](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/functions/date.html). Used for the date display and for a semantic `time` element.
- `extras` (Block): Additional supporting content, for example an [inline list](/docs/objects-list--inline) of related links.
- `heading_level`: Specifies the level of `h*` element to use. Should be one lower than whatever the preceding section heading is to preserve the document outline. Defaults to `3`.
- `link`: An external URL for the event.
- `location`: The location of the event, for example "Portland, OR" or "Online."
- `title`: The name of the event, for example "An Event Apart."
