// This can be revisited in the future if Storybook no longer relies on Webpack.

# Logo Group

Logo Group can be used to display a group of logos, such as a summary of past clients. Logos break onto multiple lines depending on the available space and are vertically centered.

To enforce consistent sizing or fine-tune alignment, consider using [Logo components](/docs/components-logo--basic-options) within the Logo Group.
