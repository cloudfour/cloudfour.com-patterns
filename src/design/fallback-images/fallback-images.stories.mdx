# Fallback Images

We've created a few different fallback images in the instance that an article doesn't have its own image. The goal was to not have them compete too much with intentional images, but we also wanted them to be on brand. This design also leaves room to add more categories if desired.

The captions below each fallback image aren't set in stone, moreso just ideas that these designs could be used for.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Fallback Images" args={{ class: 'o-deck--2-column@l' }}>
    {fallbackImage}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
