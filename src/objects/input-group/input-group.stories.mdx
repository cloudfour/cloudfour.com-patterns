// This can be revisited in the future if Storybook no longer relies on Webpack.

## Input Group

The Input Group layout combines the [Button](/story/components-button--button-element) and [Input](/story/components-input--text-elements) components and places them next to each other with no padding or margin. This would work well in creating design elements like search bars.

Buttons and inputs can be put in whatever order you choose.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Example"
    parameters={{
      docs: {
        source: {
          code: inputGroupDemoSource,
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    {inputGroupDemo}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
