# Themes

Themes may be applied to a containing element to dramatically change that content's appearance. Theme classes are always prefixed by `t-`.

While selector depth is best kept to a minimum, it's permissible to style objects and components differently within a theme class. If you find you are working _against_ a theme class a lot, it may be a sign that you really need a whole new pattern and modifier (instead of just a themed variation).

## Dark

`t-dark` is intended primarily for page headers.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Dark">{demo({ theme: 'dark' })}</Story>
</Canvas>
