# Containers

Containers are helpful for layouts, they provide a maximum width and center content on large screens. Margins and/or padding should be applied to the outer container `o-container` to keep content centered.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic" height="300px" args={{ prose: false }}>
    {(args) => basicDemo(args)}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Prose

The `--prose` modifier is intended to be used with content that mostly consists of text, like an article. It helps improve readability by limiting line length.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Prose" height="300px" args={{ prose: true }}>
    {(args) => basicDemo(args)}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
