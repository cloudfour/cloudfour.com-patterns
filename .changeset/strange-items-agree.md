Revised icon set! All icons have improved weights and proportions. There are now more `caret-` icons and a `speech-balloon` icon. The `notifications-off` icon has been removed since we now have dynamic toggle icons. Other icons have been renamed to separate what they are from how they are used: `attachment` is now `paperclip`, `close` is now `x`, `notifications` is now `bell`, `reply` is now `arrow-down-right`, `return` is now `arrow-hook-left` and `search` is now `magnifying-glass`.
