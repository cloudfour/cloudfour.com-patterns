# Overview

The Overview object can be used to provide an overview of a site section. For example, it is used to provide an index of article categories, as well as a form to search for articles.

It handles the responsive layout of `header`, `actions`, and `content` blocks. On small screens they are stacked vertically. On large screens the `header` and `actions` blocks stack horizontally above the `content` block.

It should usually be placed in a [Container](/docs/objects-container--basic).

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Basic"
    height="300px"
    parameters={{
      docs: {
        source: {
          code: basicDemoSource,
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    {basicDemo.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Advanced Usage

Here's a more complex usage example, showing how the Overview object could be used on the article listing page.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Advanced Usage"
    height="300px"
    parameters={{
      docs: {
        source: {
          code: advancedDemoSource,
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    {advancedDemo({ topics })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Template Properties

- `overview_tag` - defaults to `section` but can be switched out for any HTML tag.
- `labelledby_id` - an optional ID to use with the `aria-labelledby` attribute.

## Template blocks

- `header` - should generally contain a [Heading](/docs/components-heading--levels)
- `actions` - could contain a searchbar or other actions
- `content` the primary overview content. For example, a list of categories.
