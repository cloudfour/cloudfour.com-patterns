# Footnote Link

A simple container for displaying important messages to the user such as errors, changes in state or confirmation of actions taken.

## Basic usage

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic" args={{ count: 1 }}>
    {(args) => `
      Micro-interactions are small, singular interactions that serve one
      purpose: communicate meaningful feedback to users in a positive and
      welcoming way ${template(args)}.
      People like to constantly know what’s going to happen when an action is
      performed and tend to expect something to happen when they interact with
      it. The pop of the heart when you favorite a post, the elasticity of
      pull-to-refresh, or even snoozing your alarm are all examples of
      micro-interactions we experience every day.
      I think it’s important to take the extra time to make these experiences
      feel more human.
