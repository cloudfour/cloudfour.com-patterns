# Bio

The Bio layout object can be used for the bio pages. It helps layout the bio avatar, content and optional meta information (commonly used for bio links).

This layout object _does not_ style the contents within the layout.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default"
    parameters={{
      docs: {
        source: {
          code: defaultDemoSource,
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    {defaultDemo}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Template Properties

- `avatar` (block): Block to add a bio avatar.
- `content` (block): Block to add the main bio content.
- `meta` (block): Optional block to add meta information (e.g. bio links).
