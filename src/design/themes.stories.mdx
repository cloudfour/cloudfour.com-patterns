# Themes

Themes may be applied to a containing element to change that content's appearance. Theme classes are always prefixed by `t-`, for example `t-dark`. The majority of theme differences are toggled via [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), which keeps theme code lean and selector conflicts minimal. Themes may be nested in other themes.

## Light

The default theme, applied to the document `:root` by default.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Light"
    parameters={{ theme: 't-light' }}
    args={{ theme: 'light' }}
  >
    {demoStory.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Dark

Optimized for page intros and headings.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Dark" parameters={{ theme: 't-dark' }} args={{ theme: 'dark' }}>
    {demoStory.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Alternate

An alternate, or secondary, theme that can offset a section of content visually from its surroundings. This may be helpful for distinguishing rows of content from one another in a subtle way.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Alternate with Light"
    parameters={{ theme: 't-light' }}
    args={{ theme: 'light' }}
  >
    {(args) => alternateDemo(args)}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Alternate with Dark"
    parameters={{ theme: 't-dark' }}
    args={{ theme: 'dark' }}
  >
    {(args) => alternateDemo(args)}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Coming soon

- Better progressive enhancement (sensible default values for older browsers)
