// The '!!raw-loader!' syntax is a non-standard, Webpack-specific, syntax.

// For now, it seems likely Storybook is pretty tied to Webpack, therefore, we
// are okay with the following Webpack-specific raw loader syntax. It's better
// to leave the ESLint rule enabled globally, and only thoughtfully disable as
// needed (e.g. within a Storybook docs page and not within an actual
// component). This can be revisited in the future if Storybook no longer relies
// on Webpack.

# Form Group

The Form Group layout object groups a label and its corresponding control.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Basic"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: basicDemoSource } } }}
  >
    {() => basicDemo()}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With more label content

The `label` content may be set as a template property or a content block. In this example, we use the block to append [a Badge component](/?path=/docs/components-badge--basic) noting that this is a required field.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="With badge"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: badgeDemoSource } } }}
  >
    {() => badgeDemo()}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Template Properties

- `class`: Append a class to the root element.
- `label`: Label text.
- `label` (block): Label content.
- `control` (block): Block to add controls/inputs.
