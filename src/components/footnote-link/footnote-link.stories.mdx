# Footnote Link

A link to a footnote. Intended to be matched with a [Footnote](/docs/components-footnote-footnote--basic).

## Basic usage

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Basic"
    args={{ count: 1 }}
    parameters={{
      docs: {
        source: {
          code: footnoteLinkSource,
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    {(args) => template(args)}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Template Properties

- `count` (number) the number of the current footnote we're on (e.g. this is the second footnote in the document)
- `id` (string) a unique ID for a footnote. Defaults to the `count` but should be customized if there are multiple sets of footnotes on one page
