# Dot Leader

A component that associates a chunk of text with a piece of reference data via a long line of dots, similar to a traditional table of contents or index.

A single dot leader is composed of four elements:

- `c-dot-leader` contains the entire row.
- `c-dot-leader__start`
- `c-dot-leader__between` will output dots and should always include `aria-hidden="true"` so that it will not be read aloud by assistive devices.
- `c-dot-leader__end`

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Single" args={argDefaults} argTypes={argTypes}>
    {(args) => template(args)}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

If `c-dot-leader` is an `<a>` element, it will gain some additional styles.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Link"
    args={{
      href: 'https://cloudfour.com/topics/design-systems/',
      ...argDefaults,
    }}
    argTypes={argTypes}
  >
    {(args) => template(args)}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Although `c-dot-leader` applies to a single row, the pattern works best as part of [a list object](/docs/objects-list--default-story). The dotted lines clearly associate each column even when content lengths vary.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="List"
    parameters={{
      docs: {
        source: {
          code: listDemoSource,
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    {listDemo({ topics })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
