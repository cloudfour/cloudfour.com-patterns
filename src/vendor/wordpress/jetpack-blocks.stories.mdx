# Jetpack Blocks

WordPress developer Automattic provides a [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/) plugin that includes additional blocks. We support a selection of these.

## Markdown Block

The markdown block applies vertical rhythm between its children. If contained within a [Rhythm object](/docs/objects-rhythm--default-story), the markdown block will inherit the same spacing. For example, if the Rhythm object uses the `o-rhythm--generous` modifier, the markdown block will inherit the generous spacing.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Markdown">
    {`<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">
      <p>
        <b>Lorem</b> <i>ipsum</i> dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quisque eu ex
        enim. Nunc efficitur scelerisque dolor et sollicitudin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Donec finibus lorem elit, eu consectetur quam pellentesque sed.
        Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada
        fames ac turpis egestas.

## Form Blocks

Jetpack includes [a Form Block](https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-blocks/contact-form/) which may be used to construct contact forms from various form field blocks.

Our styles include customizations for some of these form elements, with some exceptions:

- We do not have a custom radio input style yet. For now, the default browser styles are used.
- We do not support Jetpack's style customizations. These would make forms feel inconsistent with the rest of our experience.
- We do not optimize our styles for Jetpack's jQuery UI enhancements, which we recommend [dequeuing](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_dequeue_script/) and/or [deregistering](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_deregister_script/) where possible for performance.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Contact Form" parameters={{ layout: 'fullscreen' }}>
    {contactFormDemo}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

The success messaging markup generated by these blocks is pretty quirky, but we do our best to style it.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Contact Form Success" parameters={{ layout: 'fullscreen' }}>
    {contactFormSuccessDemo}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
