# Display

Utilities for specifying the display type of an element.

Contrary to other categories of utilities, there is no shared `display-*` class name prefix. This is for two main reasons:

- It would be confusing for display utilities that do not conform to a known display type (for example, `u-hidden-visually`) to include this segment.
- Display utilities are more likely to serve as a base for other dependent utility classes. It is more intuitive to have a (currently hypothetical) `u-flex` class and `u-flex-align-items-center` than it would be `u-display-flex` and `u-flex-align-items-center`.

## Hidden Visually

The `u-hidden-visually` class applies a complex set of CSS rules that obscure an element visually but [not from assistive technology like screen readers](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/see-no-evil-hidden-content-and-accessibility/#showing-additional-content-for-screen-readers).

In this example, the link will include text when read aloud:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Hidden Visually">{hiddenVisuallyDemo}</Story>
</Canvas>

## Clearfix

The `u-clearfix` class forces a container to expand to fit floated children.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Clearfix">{clearfixDemo}</Story>
</Canvas>

## Rescue Orphan

The `u-rescue-orphan` class can wrap the last few words of a chunk of text, attempting to keep them together unless space limitations force a break. This can help reduce the chance of [a typographic orphan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans) in some situations.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Rescue Orphan">{rescueOrphanDemo}</Story>
</Canvas>
