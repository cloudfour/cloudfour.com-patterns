# Pagination

Displays a horizontal list of page number links, including extra affordances for those representing the "previous" and "next" pages.

The component supports variable amounts of page numbers and will adjust its layout accordingly. For best results on small screens, we recommend a maximum link count of 5.

As the viewport widens, individual numbers may drift awkwardly far apart. You can prevent this by wrapping the component in [a container](/?path=/docs/objects-container--basic).

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Example"
    argTypes={{
      current: { type: { name: 'number' }, defaultValue: 2 },
      midSize: { type: { name: 'number' }, defaultValue: 2 },
      total: { type: { name: 'number' }, defaultValue: 36 },
    }}
  >
    {(args) => template({ pagination: mockPaginationData(args) })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Elements

- `c-pagination`: A containing `<nav>` element.
- `c-pagination__items`: A `<ul>` containing the page links.
- `c-pagination__item`: An individual list item.
- `c-pagination__action`: The link (or possibly in the future, button) that navigates to the page.
- `c-pagination__number`: Wrapper for the page number within `c-pagination__action`.

## Action States

In addition to the usual hover, active and focus states, `c-pagination__action` supports three more:

- An `aria-current` attribute (typically with a value of `page`) to identify the current page action.
- `is-previous` or `is-next` classes to identify the _previous_ or _next_ page action.

## Accessibility

Like all navigation patterns, pagination is potentially fraught with accessibility issues. Here's what we've done to make this component more inclusive:

- The outer `<nav>` element clearly identifies this component as navigation to assistive devices.
- Said element includes an `aria-labelledby` attribute, which maps to the ID of a [visually hidden](/?path=/docs/utilities-display--hidden-visually) heading element within. We use `aria-labelledby` instead of `aria-label` to improve [compatibility with translation tools](https://heydonworks.com/article/aria-label-is-a-xenophobe/).
- The `<ul>` element containing list items includes a `role="list"` attribute to avoid [an issue in Safari/VoiceOver](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html).
- All page actions include [visually hidden text for context](https://www.a11ymatters.com/pattern/pagination/#2--labeling-the-navigation-links) ("Page 4" instead of simply "4").
- The current page action is identified using [the `aria-current` attribute](https://tink.uk/using-the-aria-current-attribute/).
- It is common to output multiple links for "previous" and "next" for styling purposes, but we've avoided that so no page number is read aloud multiple times.

## Template Properties

The Twig template expects to receive a `pagination` object with the same structure as [`posts.pagination` in Timber](https://timber.github.io/docs/guides/pagination/), streamlining integration with WordPress projects that use that plugin.

It also introduces properties to control the accessible label:

- `label_id`: ID for the accessible label. Defaults to `pagination-label`. Must be unique per page.
- `label_tag_name`: Tag for the accessible label. Defaults to `h2`, but should be adjusted depending on current document outline.
