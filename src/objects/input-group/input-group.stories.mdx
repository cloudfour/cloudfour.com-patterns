// This can be revisited in the future if Storybook no longer relies on Webpack.

## Input Group

The Input Group object accepts controls like [Button](/story/components-button--button-element) and [Input](/story/components-input--text-elements), displaying them adjacent to one another with no whitespace between. This is useful for presenting minimal forms, such as search bars.

Buttons and inputs can be put in whatever order you choose.

        },
      },
    }}
