// This can be revisited in the future if Storybook no longer relies on Webpack.

# Feature Group

The Feature Group layout object can be used by individual sections on a page to place content. It is helpful for highlighting a section by giving it a distinct layout. It includes an introduction, main content area, and an optional link.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default"
    height="300px"
    parameters={{
      docs: {
        source: {
          code: defaultDemoSource,
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    {defaultDemo}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
