# Rounded Corners

Utilities for controlling the `border-radius` of an element.

## Sizes

`u-rounded` applies the default rounded corner size, as seen in components like [Button](/docs/components-button--elements) and [Input](/docs/components-input--text-elements).

`u-rounded-full` applies as much rounding as possible evenly. This results in circular or pill-shaped elements.

`u-rounded-none` omits rounded corners entirely.
