# Text

Utilities for controlling text properties.

## White-space nowrap

- `u-text-no-wrap`

Utility for controlling the white-space wrapping of text, applies `white-space: nowrap`.

Notice in the second example how the `some-long-text` text doesn't wrap.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="White-space nowrap"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: noWrapDemoSource } } }}
  >
    {(args) => noWrapDemo(args)}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Action text

- `u-text-action`

Utility that changes the text color to the "action" text color.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Action text"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: colorDemoSource } } }}
  >
    {(args) => colorDemo(args)}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
