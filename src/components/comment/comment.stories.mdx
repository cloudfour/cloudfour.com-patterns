# Comment

Displays a single comment in a comment thread, optionally with replies. Multiple comments can be displayed within [a Rhythm layout object](/docs/objects-rhythm--default-story).

## Status

This component is still a work in progress. The following features are still in development:

- Integrating the comment reply form.
- Finalizing this pattern's blocks and properties for theme integration.

## Single

At minimum, a single comment consists of:

- Author name
- Author avatar
- Comment content (HTML)
- Publication date
- Permalink to the comment

This information may be passed to the component as a `comment` object matching the structure of a [Timber comment](https://timber.github.io/docs/reference/timber-comment/).

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Single">{template({ comment: makeComment() })}</Story>
</Canvas>

## Role badges

It is helpful for context within a discussion to know when a commentor is the original post author or a Cloud Four team member. The mechanics of this feature are still in development, but these stories show how these roles should appear using [the Badge component](/docs/components-badge--basic).

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Role: Author">
    {template({ comment: makeComment(), demo_post_author: true })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Role: Cloud Four">
    {template({ comment: makeComment(), demo_cloud_four_member: true })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Unapproved

If `comment.approved` is not `true`, an [Alert](/docs/components-alert--basic) will indicate that the comment is not yet approved.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Unapproved">
    {template({ comment: makeComment({ approved: false }) })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With source

Additionally, a `source` object may be passed to the template consisting of a `url` and `name`. This is helpful if integrating [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) into comment threads.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With source">
    {template({
      comment: makeComment(),
      source: {
        url: 'https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/1371521325236416516',
        name: 'twitter.com',
      },
    })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With reply button

This feature is still a work in progress.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With reply button">
    {template({
      comment: makeComment(),
      demo_control: true,
    })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With reply thread

If a `comment` contains an array of `children`, they will be display in the footer of the original comment. A vertical line is used to visually associate the replies with the original comment. If the parent comment is contained within [a Rhythm layout object](/docs/objects-rhythm--default-story),the child comments will inherit that spacing.

While it is theoretically possible to infinitely nest `children`, it's recommended to limit the depth to a single level. This is for two reasons:

- Increasingly narrow comments will become difficult to read on narrow screens.
- The heading levels for comment threads increment up to a maximum of six (since HTML only provides six heading levels). This means that levels beyond that will be harder to traverse for user agents navigating via the document outline.

  </Story>
