# Dot Leader

A component that associates a chunk of text with a piece of reference data via a long line of dots, similar to a traditional table of contents or index.

A single dot leader is composed of four elements:

- `c-dot-leader` contains the entire row.
- `c-dot-leader__start`
- `c-dot-leader__between` will output dots and should always include `aria-hidden="true"` so that it will not be read aloud by assistive devices.
- `c-dot-leader__end`

    {template({
      label: text('label', 'Design systems'),
      count: text('count', 42),

      count_noun_single: text('count_noun_single', 'article'),
      count_noun_plural: text('count_noun_plural', 'articles'),
    })}

If `c-dot-leader` is an `<a>` element, it will gain some additional styles.

      count_noun_single: text('count_noun_single', 'article'),
      count_noun_plural: text('count_noun_plural', 'articles'),
    })}

Although `c-dot-leader` applies to a single row, the pattern works best as part of a list. The dotted lines clearly associate each column even when content lengths vary.
