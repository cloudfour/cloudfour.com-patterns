# Display

Utilities for specifying the display type of an element.

Contrary to other categories of utilities, there is no shared `display-*` class name prefix. This is for two main reasons:

- It would be confusing for display utilities that do not conform to a known display type (for example, `u-hidden-visually`) to include this segment.
- Display utilities are more likely to serve as a base for other dependent utility classes. It is more intuitive to have a (currently hypothetical) `u-flex` class and `u-flex-align-items-center` than it would be `u-display-flex` and `u-flex-align-items-center`.

## Hidden Visually

The `u-hidden-visually` class applies a complex set of CSS rules that obscure an element visually but [not from assistive technology like screen readers](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/see-no-evil-hidden-content-and-accessibility/#showing-additional-content-for-screen-readers).

In this example, the link will include text when read aloud:

<Preview>
  <Story name="Hidden Visually" height="100px">
    {hiddenVisuallyDemo}
  </Story>
</Preview>
