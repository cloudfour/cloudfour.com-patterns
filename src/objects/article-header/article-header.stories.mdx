# Article Header

The Article Header layout object composes an article's title and meta information. The "eyebrow" block is visually oriented above the title, providing additional context up-front (such as the article's taxonomy).

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Example"
    parameters={{
      docs: {
        source: {
          code: exampleDemoSource,
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    {exampleDemo()}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
