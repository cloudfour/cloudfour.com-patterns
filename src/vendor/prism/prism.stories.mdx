# Prism

Our CSS used to include a custom [Prism](https://prismjs.com/index.html) theme for syntax highlighting, but we have started moving to server-side rendering of syntax highlighting where possible, so we've transitioned that responsibility to [our Highlight theme](/?path=/docs/vendor-highlight--example).

For legacy projects or content that requires client-side rendering, we will continue to include the Prism theme in this package as a separate stylesheet:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="node_modules/@cloudfour/patterns/dist/prism-theme.min.css"
/>
```
