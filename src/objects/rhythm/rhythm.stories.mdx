# Rhythm

The `o-rhythm` class applies [consistent vertical spacing between child elements](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/).

The default spacing works great for medium-to-long text content:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">{introDemo}</Story>
</Canvas>

## Modifiers

For shorter summary content, use the `o-rhythm--condensed` modifier to tighten things up a bit:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Condensed">{summaryDemo}</Story>
</Canvas>

`o-rhythm--compact` is best for shorter content chunks that just need a _pinch_ more space:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Compact">{listDemo}</Story>
</Canvas>

While `o-rhythm--generous` is intended for separating distinct content chunks with more whitespace:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Generous">{sectionsDemo}</Story>
</Canvas>

## Heading Modifiers

The `o-rhythm--generous-headings` modifier helps differentiate sections of articles (or similarly long prose content) by adding more whitespace before headings than other elements.

<!--
This example isn't inlined so any media queries affecting the container will
behave as expected.
-->

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Generous Headings" inline={false}>
    {articleDemo}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Inheriting Rhythm

The vertical spacing applied by the Rhythm object only applies to direct children. In some cases, you may want elements below to inherit rhythm. This can be accomplished in two main ways.

### Via HTML

If you have access to the markup, you can add the `o-rhythm` class to the child element:

```html
<div class="o-rhythm o-rhythm--condensed">
  <!-- ... -->
  <div class="o-rhythm">
    <!-- will also be condensed -->
  </div>
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

### Via Sass

Our project includes an `adjacent.rhythm` mixin that will apply the basic object rules to any selector:

```scss
@use 'path/to/mixins/adjacent';

.unchangeable-vendor-selector {
  @include adjacent.rhythm();
}
```

## Custom Properties

- `--rhythm`: Amount of vertical space between adjacent elements. Defaults to our `$rhythm-default` [size token](/docs/design-tokens-size--page#rhythm).
- `--rhythm-headings`: Extra space to precede headings that follow another element. Defaults to the value of `--rhythm`.
