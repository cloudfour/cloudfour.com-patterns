# Size

Utilities for specifying the size occupied by an element. While largely unnecessary in objects and components thanks to [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), these utilities can still be useful for fine-tuning one-off elements in page content.

## Logical Properties

All of our utilities use [logical properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-logical-1/) instead of specific directions [in supported browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-logical-props) to simplify potential localization projects.

The following table maps the traditional physical property for `direction: ltr` and `writing-mode: horizontal-tb` to its equivalent logical property:

| Physical Property | Logical Property |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| `height`          | `block-size`     |
| `width`           | `inline-size`    |

You can observe how utilities respond to various `direction` and `writing-mode` values by selecting a different "Text flow" in this project's toolbar.

## Inline size

Utilities beginning with `u-size-inline-` specify the `inline-size` of an element:

- `u-size-inline-{fraction}` for percentage widths, where `{fraction}` represents the desired ratio. For example, `u-size-inline-2/5` would set `inline-size` to `40%`. Fractions with denominators of `2` through `6` are supported.
- `u-size-inline-full` sets the `inline-size` to `100%` of the container.
- `u-size-inline-auto` sets the `inline-size` to the natural value for the element.

## Responsive

All of these utilities include responsive variations. Appending `@{breakpoint}` to the end of the class name will cause the utility to change for the given breakpoint.
