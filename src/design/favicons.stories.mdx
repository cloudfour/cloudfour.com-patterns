# Favicons

Historically many different icon files were necessary, but starting in 2021 we decided to follow [Andrey Sitnik's recommendation](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs) to provide five critical icons:

- A 32-pixel `favicon.ico` for legacy browsers
- An SVG icon for modern browsers
- A 180-pixel PNG for Apple devices
- A 192-pixel PNG for Android devices
- A 512-pixel PNG for Android splash screens
