# Themes

Themes may be applied to a containing element to dramatically change that content's appearance. Theme classes are always prefixed by `t-`.

While selector depth is best kept to a minimum, it's permissable to style objects and components differently within a theme class. If you find you are working _against_ a theme class a lot, it may be a sign that you really need a whole new pattern and modifier (instead of just a themed variation).

## Dark

`t-dark` is intended primarily for page headers.

export const parameters = { themes: { disable: true } };
// Parameters has to be defined separately because of this prettier bug:
// https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/7731
// https://mdxjs.com/getting-started#defining-variables-with-exports
