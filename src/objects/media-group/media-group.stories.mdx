# Media Group

Media Group can be used to display a group of media items. On small screens items in the group are vertically stacked with consistent spacing. On larger screens, items are split into columns and media objects are vertically aligned.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: defaultDemoSource } } }}
  >
    {defaultDemo({ items: objects })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Template blocks

- `items` - should contain individual media items. Each item has two parts, an `object` and `content`.
- `object` - for the static object, like an image, avatar, etc. This element will be sized auto, so it should have a defined width.
- `content` - for the wrapping content. Content is top-aligned with the object.
