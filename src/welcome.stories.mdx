# Welcome!

This is the pattern library for Cloud Four.

## Installation

### Download Compiled CSS and JS

Coming soon.

### Package Managers

The package includes both the compiled code and the source files. So you can either include the compiled CSS and JS directly, or load the source files using your own build system. If you use the source files, you'll need to compile them yourself using Sass and PostCSS.

You can add the pattern library package as a dependency to your JavaScript application using npm or yarn:

```
npm install @cloudfour/patterns

or

yarn add @cloudfour/patterns
```
