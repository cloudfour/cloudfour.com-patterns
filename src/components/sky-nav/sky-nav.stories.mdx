# Sky Nav

<!-- This will eventually be our primary navigation component. Right now, we're just critiquing some markup updates in terms of their accessibility.

We are tentatively using the same template properties as [Timber Menus](https://timber.github.io/docs/guides/menus/). -->

**Note:** This component is currently a work in progress.

Our primary navigation component, intended for the very top of a page layout. Its layout and behavior depends on the viewport width:

- By default, menu items are hidden until toggled. They are revealed _above_ the brand and toggle, as if looking upward toward the sky.
- In wider viewports, menu items are visible by default. They are displayed on multiple rows as needed.
- At even wider viewports, the menu items are displayed in a single row.

The Sky Nav is intended for use with our [our dark theme](/?path=/docs/themes--dark):

<Preview>
  <Story name="Dark" height="150px" parameters={{ themes: { disable: true } }}>
    {template({ class: 't-dark', include_main_demo: true, menu })}
  </Story>
</Preview>

But it works without a theme, too, just in case:

<Preview>
  <Story name="Light" height="150px">
    {template({ include_main_demo: true, menu })}
  </Story>
</Preview>
