# Media Group

Media Group can be used to display a group of media items. By default items in the group are vertically stacked with consistent spacing.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: defaultDemoSource } } }}
  >
    {defaultDemo({ items: objects })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Columns

Media Group can be divided into columns using the modifier class `o-media-group--X-column@Y`. `X` represents the number of columns (from 2 to 4) and `Y` is the desired breakpoint (from `s` to `xl`).

When using the modifier, media object and content containers are sized consistently. This helps the media object and content to align vertically with the other items in their column.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Columns"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: defaultDemoSource } } }}
    args={{ class: 'o-media-group--2-column@l' }}
  >
    {(args) => defaultDemo({ ...args, items: objects })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Template blocks

- `items` - should contain individual media items. Each item has two parts, an `object` and `content`.
- `object` - for the static object, like an image, avatar, etc.
- `content` - for the wrapping content. Content is top-aligned with the object.
