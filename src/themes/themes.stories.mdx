# Themes

Themes may be applied to a containing element to dramatically change that content's appearance. Theme classes are always prefixed by `t-`. Theme differences are toggled via [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) to support nesting without selector conflicts.

The default theme is "light" and is applied to the document `:root` by default. The `t-dark` class may be applied to child elements. The `t-light` class may be applied to switch _back_ to the "light" theme from within a dark container.
